    <!-- Use minified version with shitload of stuff we don't need until we figure out why build.py fails
         at least on OSX.
         We cannot use the capstone package for node since that uses native bindings.
         Additionally that server side module isn't working properly ATM due to ffi compatibility problems.
         ffi isn't properly listed as a dependency and installing it causes errors most likely due to
         function signature changes.

         Instead we use lib/capstone as a wrapper to load it server side and browser side the same way.
         We modified the minified capstone a bit to export itself whenever `module` exists.
